# Store Procedure

### `What is a Stored Procedures:`

A **stored procedure** in a database is like a recipe or a set of instructions. It allows you to store a sequence of database operations that can be reused whenever needed. Instead of writing the same instructions repeatedly, you can save them as a stored procedure and execute them with a single command. This helps make database operations more efficient and easier to manage.

#### **_`For Example:`_**

Imagine you have a recipe for your favorite chocolate chip cookies. Instead of rewriting the recipe every time you want to bake cookies, you can store it in a recipe book. That way, you can easily find it and follow the instructions whenever you have a craving.

### `why we use Store Prodcedure:`

1. **Code Reusability**: Instead of writing the same SQL code repeatedly in different parts of your application, you can write it once in a stored procedure and then call the procedure wherever needed.

2. **Improved Performance**: Stored procedures are precompiled and stored in the database. This can lead to better performance compared to executing the same SQL statements dynamically from your application.

3. **Security**: Using stored procedures can enhance security by allowing you to grant permissions at the procedure level rather than on the underlying tables. This can help protect your data from unauthorized access.

4. **Reduced Network Traffic**: Since the stored procedure is executed on the database server, only the procedure call needs to be sent over the network, reducing the amount of data transferred.

5. **Encapsulation of Business Logic**: Stored procedures can encapsulate complex business logic, making it easier to manage and maintain your application code.

6. **Ease of Maintenance**: If you need to modify a query or logic in your application, you only need to update the stored procedure rather than making changes in multiple places in your code.

### `Advantage of Store Procedure:`

| **_`Advantage`_**        | **_`Description`_**                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Structured Data Storage  | Tables provide a structured way to store data, making it easy to organize and retrieve information.           |
| Efficient Data Retrieval | Using tables allows for efficient retrieval of data through SQL queries, especially with proper indexes.      |
| Data Integrity           | Tables can enforce data integrity through constraints like primary keys, foreign keys, and check constraints. |
| Flexibility              | Tables can store different types of data and allow for complex relationships between data entities.           |
| Reduced Network Traffic  | Send only the procedure name, not the entire set of instructions.                                             |

### `Disadvantage of Store Procedure:`

| **Disadvantage**     | **Description**                                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Increased Complexity | Debugging and troubleshooting procedures can be more complex than simple queries. |
| Development Time     | Initial creation of procedures takes extra time compared to a single query.       |
| Vendor Dependence    | Procedures may not be portable across different database systems.                 |

# Introduction to MySQL

MySQL is a widely used, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It enables users to  
store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently in a structured format. Think of it as a digital filing 
cabinet that organizes your information into tables, rows, and columns, making it easy to find and use 
specific data whenever you need it.


## Here are some key characteristics of MySQL:

### *Open-source*: 
   This means that the source code is freely available, allowing anyone to modify and distribute it. This has contributed to its widespread adoption and large community of developers.
### *Relational*: 
   Data is stored in tables with relationships between them, enabling you to retrieve information from multiple tables at once. This makes it suitable for complex data organization and analysis.
### *Fast and reliable*: 
   MySQL is known for its performance and stability, even when handling large amounts of data. This makes it a popular choice for web applications and other data-intensive tasks.
### *Scalable*: 
   MySQL can be easily scaled to accommodate growing data requirements. You can start with a small server and add more as your needs increase.
### *Easy to use*: 
   MySQL uses Structured Query Language (SQL), a standardized language for interacting with databases. This makes it relatively easy to learn and use, even for people with limited technical experience.

## Here are some of the common applications of MySQL:

### *Websites and web applications*: 
   Many websites and web applications, such as blogs, e-commerce platforms, and social media sites, use MySQL to store user data, product information, and other website content.
### *Content management systems (CMS)*: 
   Popular CMS platforms like WordPress and Drupal use MySQL to store website content and user data.
### *Data analysis and reporting*:
   MySQL can be used to store and analyze data for various purposes, such as business intelligence, market research, and scientific research.

If you're looking for a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use database management system, MySQL is a great option. It's a popular choice for a wide range of applications, from small personal projects to large enterprise systems.


## Purposes:

MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL as its query language. Its main purposes include:

### 1. *Data Storage and Retrieval:* 
MySQL is designed to efficiently store and retrieve data. It allows users to create, modify, and query databases to manage large sets of structured information.

### 2. *Data Security:* 
MySQL provides authentication and access control mechanisms, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify the data. This is crucial for protecting sensitive information.

### 3. *Scalability:* 
MySQL can handle a large amount of data and is scalable to accommodate growing datasets. It is suitable for both small-scale applications and large enterprise-level systems.

### 4. *Concurrency Control:* 
MySQL manages multiple users accessing the database simultaneously. It employs various techniques to ensure data consistency and integrity even when multiple users are making changes concurrently.

### 5. *Data Integrity:* 
MySQL supports the definition of relationships between tables, enforcing referential integrity. This ensures that the data in the database remains accurate and consistent.

### 6. *Performance Optimization:* 
It includes features like indexing, caching, and query optimization to enhance performance. These optimizations help in executing queries faster, especially in large datasets.

### 7. *Reliability and Availability:* 
MySQL is known for its reliability and uptime. It provides features like replication and clustering to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

### 8. *Community Support:*
Being open-source, MySQL has a large and active community that contributes to its development and provides support. This community-driven approach ensures continuous improvement and a wealth of resources for users.

Understanding these aspects can help users leverage MySQL effectively for their data storage and retrieval needs, whether it's for a small project or a large-scale enterprise application.

## Advantages & Disadvantages:

### *Advantages of MySQL:*

1. *Open Source:* MySQL is free to use and is open-source, making it cost-effective for small businesses and individuals.

2. *Community Support:* It has a large and active community, providing extensive documentation, tutorials, and forums for support.

3. *Scalability:* MySQL can handle large amounts of data and is scalable, making it suitable for both small projects and large-scale applications.

4. *Performance:* With features like indexing and caching, MySQL is optimized for quick query execution, contributing to good performance.

### How to Select Database
```sql
### How to Select Database
 USE <Dbname> || use <Dbname>
USE mydb || use mydb
```

### How to Select all Table fields in Database using "*" 
- First Select Database
- Select table
- Also use semicolon ; at the end of each statement

```sql
USE mydb;
SELECT * FROM customer;
```

### How to Select and filter a specific row using WHERE Clause
```sql
USE mydb;
SELECT * 
FROM customer
WHERE customer_id = 5;
```

### How to Select Table and sort using First_name with ORDER BY Clause
```sql
USE mydb;
SELECT * 
FROM customer
-- WHERE customer_id = 5  "--" Double Hyphen is used to comment something
ORDER BY first_name;

```
### How to Select a specific fields with field name
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name , points FROM customer;
```

### How to Select a specific fields with field name and calculate something in run time
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name , points, points+10 FROM customer;

```
### Select specific field and calculate something but change calculated name in run time with AS Alias
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name , points, (points+10)*100 AS discount_factor FROM customer;
```

### if you want to add Space in Alias name
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name , points, (points+10)*100 AS 'Discount Factor' FROM customer;
```

### How to select only unique and non duplicate value 
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM customer;
```
- Make sure if you use SELECT DISTINCT first_name, city FROM customer it means both first_name and city
must be distinct.
- It does not mean that only the city column should be distinct.


### How to filter with WHERE Clause
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE points>1500;
``` 
- filter those records whose points are greater than 1500
- Also you should use these operators >,<,>=,<=,!=, <> 

### How to filter string matched record with WHERE Clause
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE city = 'karachi'; 
```

### How to filter those records which does not contain string 'karachi'
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE city != 'karachi'; 
or 
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE city <> 'karachi';
```

### How to filter those records whose birth_date > 2023-08-07
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE birth_date > '2023-08-07';
```

### How to filter those records whose birth_date > 2023-08-07 and Points > 1500
- We use AND operator it return true if both condition meets true
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE birth_date > '2023-08-07' AND points > 1500;
```

### How to filter those records whose birth_date > 2023-08-07 OR Points > 1500
- We use OR operator it return true if at least one  condition meets true
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE birth_date > '2023-08-07' OR points > 1500;
```

### How to filter those records whose birth_date > 2023-08-07 is NOT Greater than 
- We use NOT operator to reverse
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE NOT(birth_date > '2023-08-07' OR points > 1500);
```

### How to filter those records whose birth_date > 2023-08-07 OR Points > 1500 AND city ="kohat"
- We use OR and AND both to add multiple conditions
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE birth_date > '2023-08-07' OR (points > 1500 AND city = 'kohat');
```

### How to select those result whose city is kohat or karachi
- We use IN operator, we can also use OR operator but IN operator is shorter and it works like OR operator
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE city IN ('karachi','kohat');

```
### How to select those result whose city is not in kohat or karachi
- We use NOT IN operator
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE city NOT IN ('karachi','kohat');
```

### How to select those points >= 1000 and <= 1500
- We use BETWEEN operator, note we can also use >=  <= operators but BETWEEN is shorter
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE points BETWEEN 1000 AND 1500;
```

### How to select those rows that matched with specific string pattern using LIKE operator
- we use WHERE last_name LIKE 's%' it means last_name must be start with s but after s it contain any letters.
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE last_name LIKE 's%';
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE last_name LIKE 'summer%'; //start with summer ends with any letter
```

### change the pattern in LIKE operator
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE last_name LIKE '%s';// start with any  letter but ends with s
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE last_name LIKE '%s%';// start with any  letter and ends with any letter but s letter can be any
where
```

### Use underscore to define how many letters end with that pattern
```sql
```python
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE last_name LIKE '_______s'
```

### we can also specify first and last letter and Between letters range with "__"  underscore
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE last_name LIKE 'v______s'
```

### use  REGEXP to use complex string pattern
- Look we use like operator
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name LIKE '%hr%'
```
- we can also use REGEXP for more complex string patterns
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name REGEXP 'hr'
```
### first_name must start with hr
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name LIKE '%hr%'
```
- we can also use REGEXP for more complex string patterns
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name REGEXP 'hr'
```
### first_name must start with hr
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name REGEXP '^hr'
```

### first_name must end with t
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name REGEXP 't$'
```

### we can also use pipe operator | in REGEXP
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name REGEXP '^ch|t$'
```
- it means first_name must start with ch 
- Or first_name must end with t


### we can also specify []
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name REGEXP '[agc]t'
```
- first_name will be at, gt, ct anywhere

### we can change pattern
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name REGEXP 't[agc]'
```
- first_name will be ta, tg, tc anywhere

### we can also specify range [a-h]
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name REGEXP '[a-h]t'
```
- first_name will be at,bt,ct,dt,et,ft, gt, ht anywhere

### How to select those records whone phone no is NULL using "IS NULL" operator
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE phone IS NULL;
```
### How to select and sort data by column name 
- by default every column is sorted according  to primary key column
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer ORDER by first_name;
```
### We can also sort by multiple columns
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer ORDER by first_name;
```
### We can also sort by multiple columns
SELECT * FROM customer ORDER by first_name, last_name;
```
SELECT * FROM customer ORDER by first_name DESC, last_name ASC;
```

### How  to Select first 10 records using "LIMIT" Clause
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer LIMIT 10;
```

### How to skip  first 10 records using "LIMIT" Clause and select 3 records before 10 records
- we define offset 10 , 3
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer LIMIT 10 , 3;
```

### Reterieve Random record with RAND Function
- Please use ORDER By Clause otherwise you got an error
```
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1;
```
### How to select one table with relationship to another table using "INNER JOIN"
- lets we have orders table in orders table we have customer_id which is a foriegn key to customer table
-  In Orders table we have  orders_id, customer_id, status, comments
- In Customer table we have customer_id, first_name, last_name, birth_date, phone, address, city and state
- We want to inner join with orders table and customer table
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders INNER JOIN customerON orders.customer_id  = customer.customer_id;
```

### We can also achieve "INNER JOIN" with implicit Syntax
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders o, customers c WHERE o.customer_id  = c.customer_id;
```

### How to find only select first_name, city and phone from customer table 
```sql
SELECT order_id, orders.customer_id first_name, phone, city 
FROM orders 
INNER JOIN customer
ON 
orders.customer_id  = customer.customer_id;

```
### We can also use alias in inner join
```sql
SELECT order_id, o.customer_id first_name, phone, city 
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customer c
ON 
o.customer_id  = c.customer_id;
```

### We to join tables across Databases 
- suppose we have a Database name inventory
- In the inventory db we have products table
- this product table is associated with orders_items 
- we can easily join using db.table name
```sql
select * 
FROM orders_items oi
INNER JOIN inventory.products p
ON
oi.product_id = p.product_id;
```

### How to select only selected name, quantity from products table 
```sql
select oi.product_id, unit_price, name
FROM orders_items oi
INNER JOIN inventory.products p
ON
oi.product_id = p.product_id;
```
### How to Select Self join table itself 
- Suppose we have employe table we want to check who is manager in our complany
- But the best thing is manager is itself an employe of this complany
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees m
JOIN employees e
ON
 e.reports_to = m.employee_id;
```

### How to Select Self join table itself 
- only want to check the manager
```sql
SELECT 
e.employee_id,
e.first_name,
m.first_name as Manager
FROM employees m
JOIN employees e
ON
 e.reports_to = m.employee_id;
```

### How to JOIN multiple tables
- We have three tables orders, order_status and customer we want to join
```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders o
JOIN customer c
ON
o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN order_status os
ON os.status_is = o.status;
```
### Lets Extract Beautifully
```sql
SELECT 
o.order_id,
o.order_date,
c.first_name,
c.last_name,
os.name AS Status
FROM orders o
JOIN customer c
ON
o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN order_status os
ON os.status_is = o.status;
```
### Compound Join
- we can combine two fields to unique identify row
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM orders_items oi
JOIN order_notes oin
ON
oi.order_id = oin.order_id
AND
oi.product_id = oin.product_id;
```
### leFT Join
- Left outer join select those records which are not
- like in our example we also select those customers who don't have any order as well as who do
```sql
SELECT 
c.customer_id, 
c.first_name, 
o.order_id 
FROM customer c 
LEFT JOIN orders o 
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id 
ORDER BY c.customer_id 

```
### Right Join
- Right outer join select those records which satisfy the condition
- like in our example we only select those customers who have orders
```sql
SELECT 
c.customer_id, 
c.first_name, 
o.order_id 
FROM customer c 
LEFT JOIN orders o 
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id 
ORDER BY c.customer_id 
```

### USING Clause
- USING Clause can replace JOIN complex steps
- But it can only work when both table have same column name
```sql
SELECT 
o.order_id,
c.first_name
FROM orders o 
JOIN customer c
-- ON o.customer_id = c.first_name
USING (customer_id);
```


### Cross JOIN
- combine every record from first table to second table
- WE combine every record from customer table to products table
```sql
SELECT 
c.first_name AS customer,
p.name AS product 
FROM customer c
CROSS JOIN inventory.products p 
ORDER BY c.first_name;
```

### Combine tables rows with UNION
```sql
SELECT 
order_id,
order_date,
'Active' AS status
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2023-11-09'
UNION
SELECT 
order_id,
order_date,
'Archived' AS status
FROM orders
WHERE order_date < '2023-11-09'
```

### INSERT RECORDS
```sql
INSERT INTO customer (
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    birth_date,
    phone,
    address,
    city,
    state,
    points
) VALUES (
    52,
    'Ahmed',
    'Raheem',
    NULL,
    NULL,

    NULL,
    NULL,
    'Azad Chaiwala Institute',
    'Rawalpindi',
    'Punjab',
    DEFAULT
);

```
### INSERT Hierarchical RECORDS
```sql
INSERT INTO customer(customer_id,first_name,last_name,birth_date)
VALUES (DEFAULT,'IGI','ORIGIN','2023-12-25');

INSERT INTO orders(order_id,order_date, status,c_id)
VALUES(DEFAULT,'2023-12-25',1,LAST_INSERT_ID());

INSERT INTO
orders_items(order_items_id,order_id,product_id,unit_price,quantity)
VALUES (DEFAULT,LAST_INSERT_ID(),9,35,3);

```
### Creating Copy of a Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders_archived  AS
SELECT * FROM orders;
```


### Insert only data from one table to another
```sql
INSERT INTO orders_archived
SELECT * from orders WHERE order_date > '2023-12-01';
```

### Updating Single Record
```sql
UPDATE customer 
SET first_name="Muhammad", last_name="Hashim", birth_date="2023-12-30"
WHERE customer_id = 1;
```
### Update multiple Records
```sql
UPDATE orders_items
SET unit_price=50.57, quantity = 5
WHERE order_id = 1;
```


### Using subqueries in Update
```sql
UPDATE orders
SET comments = "Gold Customer"
WHERE c_id IN
                (SELECT customer_id
                 FROM customer
                 WHERE points > 1800);

```

### Using subqueries in Delete
```sql
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE c_id = (
			SELECT customer_id
			FROM customer 
			WHERE first_name = "Delano"
			 );

```

### Aggregate Functions
```sql
SELECT 
MAX(salary) AS Highest,
MIN(salary) AS lowest,
AVG(salary) AS average,
SUM(salary) AS total,
COUNT(salary) AS number_of_records
FROM employees;

```
### The GROUP By Clause in Aggregate Functions

```

### Write more about subqueries
- expensive than lettuce (id = 3)
- MySQL first execute innersubquery than pass it to out query
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM products 
WHERE unit_price > (
SELECT unit_price
FROM products
WHERE product_id = 3
);
```
### Write more about subqueries
- In Sql_hr database
- find employees who earn more than average 
```sql
SELECT * FROM
employees WHERE salary > (
SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees
);
```
### Write more about subqueries using IN operator
- find that product that have never been ordered 
```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE product_id NOT IN (
SELECT DISTINCT product_id
FROM order_items
);
```
### Write more about subqueries using IN operator
- find clients without invoices
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM clients 
WHERE client_id NOT IN (
SELECT DISTINCT client_id
FROM invoices
);
```
## join vs sub query
### using subqueries
- find customer who have ordered lettuce
- select customer_id , first_name, last_name
```sql
SELECT customer_id,
first_name,
last_name
FROM customers 
WHERE customer_id IN(
SELECT o.customer_id   
FROM order_items oi
JOIN orders o USING (order_id)
    WHERE product_id = 3
);
```
### using JOIN
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id,
first_name,
last_name
FROM customers c 
JOIN orders o USING(customer_id)
JOIN order_items oi USING(order_id)
WHERE oi.product_id = 3;
```
### without ALL keyword
- select invoices larger than all invoices of client 3
```sql
SELECT *
FROM invoices 
WHERE invoice_total >(
SELECT MAX(invoice_total)
    FROM invoices
    WHERE client_id = 3 
);
```
### ALL keyword
```sql
SELECT *
FROM invoices 
WHERE invoice_total > ALL(
SELECT invoice_total
    FROM invoices
    WHERE client_id = 3 
);
```
### Correlated subqueries
- For each employe
- calculate the avg salary for employee.office
- return the employee if salary > avg
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees e 
WHERE salary > (
	SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees 
    WHERE office_id = e.office_id
);

```
### The EXISTS operator
- Select client that have an invoice

- one method 
```sql
Select *
FROM clients
WHERE client_id IN (
    select DISTINCT client_id
    FROM invoices
);
```
- second method
```sql
SELECT *
FROM clients
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT client_id
    FROM invoices
) AS distinct_clients
ON clients.client_id = distinct_clients.client_id;
```
- third method
```sql
Select *
FROM clients c
WHERE EXISTS (
    select client_id
    FROM invoices
    WHERE client_id = c.client_id
);
```
### Date Functions to check dynamically current Year orders
```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = YEAR(NOW());
```
### FORMAT_DATE Function
```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(order_date,'%D %M %Y')
FROM orders;
```
### ADDING DATE Function
```sql
SELECT DATE_ADD(order_date, INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
FROM orders;
```
### IFNULL Function
```sql
SELECT 
order_id,
shipper_id
FROM orders;

SELECT 
order_id,
IFNULL(shipper_id,'Not Assigned') AS shipper
FROM orders;
```
### COALESCE Function
```sql
SELECT 
order_id,
COALESCE(shipper_id,comments,'Not Assigned') AS shipper
FROM orders;

SELECT 
order_id,
IFNULL(shipper_id,'...') AS shipperID,
COALESCE(shipper_id,comments,'Not Assigned') AS shipper
FROM orders;
```
### IF Function
```sql
SELECT 
    order_id,
    order_date,
    IF(YEAR(order_date) = YEAR(NOW()), 'Active', 'Archived') AS order_status
FROM orders;
```

### CASE  Operator
```sql
SELECT 
    order_id,
    CASE
    WHEN YEAR(order_date) = YEAR(NOW()) THEN 'Active'
    WHEN YEAR(order_date) = YEAR(NOW()) - 1 THEN 'Last Year'
    WHEN YEAR(order_date) < YEAR(NOW()) - 1 THEN 'Archived'
    ELSE 'Future'
    END AS Category
FROM orders;
```

### Practice
```sql
SELECT 
CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name) AS Customer,
points,
CASE
	WHEN points > 3000 THEN 'Gold Customer'
    WHEN points >= 2000 THEN 'Silver Customer'
	ELSE 'Bronze Customer'
    END AS category
FROM customers;
```
### Creating View
```sql
CREATE VIEW sales_by_client AS 
SELECT 
c.client_id,
c.name,
SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
FROM clients c
JOIN invoices i USING(client_id)
GROUP BY client_id, name;
```
### Drop View
```sql
DROP VIEW invoices_with_balance;
```
### Updatable View
- DISTINCT
- Aggregate functions (MIN , MAX, SUM) etc
- GROUP BY / HAVING
- UNION
- If we dont have these in mention above
- than our view is Updatable view
``` sql
=======
``` python
>>>>>>> master
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW invoices_with_balance AS
	SELECT 
	invoice_id,
	number,
	client_id,
	invoice_total,
	payment_total,
	invoice_total - payment_total AS balance,
	invoice_date,
	payment_date,
	due_date
	FROM invoices
    WHERE (invoice_total-payment_total) > 0;

DELETE FROM invoices_with_balance
WHERE invoice_id = 1;
```
- prevent view as only read-only 
- add WITH check OPTION;
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW invoices_with_balance AS
	SELECT 
	invoice_id,
	number,
	client_id,
	invoice_total,
	payment_total,
	invoice_total - payment_total AS balance,
	invoice_date,
	payment_date,
	due_date
	FROM invoices
    WHERE (invoice_total-payment_total) > 0
    WITH check OPTION;

```
### Creating Store Procedure

### Practice Procedure
- Write a stored procedure call  get_payments
- with two Parameters
-  client_id => id(5)
- payment_method_id => TINYINT(1) 0-255
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE get_payments
    (
        client_id INT,
        payment_method_id TINYINT(1)
    )
BEGIN
    SELECT * 
    from payments p
    WHERE 
    p.client_id = IFNULL(client_id, p.client_id) AND
    p.payment_method = IFNULL(payment_method_id,p.payment_method);
END
DELIMITER ;


CALL get_payments(NULL,NULL);
CALL get_payments(5,NULL);
CALL get_payments(5,2);
CALL get_payments(NULL,2);

```
### Update in  Procedure
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE make_payments
    (
        invoice_id INT,
        payment_total DECIMAL(8,2),
        payment_date DATE
    )
BEGIN
    UPDATE invoices i
    SET 
    i.payment_total = payment_total,
    i.payment_date = payment_date
    WHERE i.invoice_id = invoice_id;
END$$
DELIMITER ;


CALL make_payments(2,2223.823,'2023-01-07');

```
### Update with validation  in  Procedure

CREATE PROCEDURE make_validate_payments
    (
        invoice_id INT,
        payment_total DECIMAL(8,2),
        payment_date DATE
    )
BEGIN
	IF payment_total <= 0 THEN
    	SIGNAL SQLSTATE '22003'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = "Invalid Payment Amounts";     
    END IF;
    UPDATE invoices i
    SET 
    i.payment_total = payment_total,
    i.payment_date = payment_date
    WHERE i.invoice_id = invoice_id;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
